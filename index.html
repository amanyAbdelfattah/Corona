                <h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                    It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                    China.
                </p>
                <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>
                <p>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

                                The virus that causes COVID-19 is <a href="#">spreading from person-to-person.</a> Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                            <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>

                            <p>Current <a href="#">CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</a> is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:</p>
                            <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
                            <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>
                            <p>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.</p>
                            <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.</p>

                            <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.

Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>

                            <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>

                            <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                            <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
                            <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Why? </span>Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Why? </span>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Why? </span>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Why? </span>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Why? </span>National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Why? </span>You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these area 
                                    </p>

                            <p>Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting may have close contact2 with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under investigation. Close contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)</p>
                            <p>Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:</p>
                            <ul>

                                    <p>Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.</p>

                                    <p>Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.</p>

                                <li>

                                    <p>Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.</p>

                                    <p>The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should wear a mask when you are in the same room as the patient.</p>

                            <p>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.

                            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>

                            <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>

                            <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>

                            <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>
